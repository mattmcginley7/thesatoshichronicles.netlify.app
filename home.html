            <li>1. What is Bitcoin</li>
            <li>2. Why it matters</li>

        <h1 id="whatIsBitcoin">"Why Should I Care About Bitcoin?"</h1>

       
        <img id="traits" src="bitcoingoldfiat.png" alt="Chart comparing Bitcoin, gold and fiat currency">

        <aside>Because Bitcoin has the best traits of money ever created.</aside>

        <p>Like it or not, money is trapped in a Darwinistic evolutionary competition, and the assets that
            translate value across time and space the most efficiently are going to slowly eat those that don't.
            The right choice will secure your wealth and future. The wrong one will ruin them. 
            You must choose the right path to follow, whether or not that path is the one much less traveled.  </p>

        <p>Soon it will seem ridiculous that nations ever accepted infinity money for their finite goods and services
             and it will be even more unbelievable that humans accepted infinity money for their finite time. </p>

             <p>Finite resources deserve finite money.</p>

        <h2>What Even is Money?</h2>

        <p>Before money, people would trade their goods or services with other's goods or services.
            Imagine you as a farmer trying to pay for your haircut in chickens.
            Then imagine trying to sell a whole chicken for a couple of apples.
            This was a mess. So creating a system of value that was always relative is very important.</p>

        <p>Throughout history, humans have used many different things as money. 
        Those who lived in mountains would trade rocks with those who lived near the beach that had seashells. 
        Even feathers were used as money.
         Yes, it was that dumb and sucked, but it's all we had.
        </p>

        <p>Eventually, we discovered gold. We ended up realizing that gold is something that is hard to find that everyone wants.
             This was a big step in the evolution of money.
             It's just a dumb metal, but in terms of the attributes we care about when it comes to a system of money, like being scarce, divisible, and people wanted it for itself, 
            gold was the best thing we had. </p>

        <p>Gold is not perfect though. Gold is hidden all throughout the earth, and we're not exactly sure how much of it exists.
             So the amount of gold, (or its scarcity if you're looking at the chart) is always changing, but in pretty small amounts that keeps the value of gold pretty stable.</p>

              <p>Imagine if the amount of gold on all the earth doubled every year and that's what we used to base our money on. 
              Each year, the amount of money that you had would be worth half!
               Let's say year 1 you had $100,000. Year 2 it's only actually worth $50k! It would be impossible to save.</p>

               <p>But the actual amount of gold that we find each year compared to all that gold that exists is around 2% or so,
                so over the short and medium term, 
                gold ended up being pretty stable to base money on! 
                In that scenario where you had $100,000 in year 1, you'd have $98,000 in actual value year 2. This is the importance of scarcity, 
                it's one of the most important attributes of money. </p>

        <p>But, gold is not without its limitations. 
            It is not easy to move in large quantities.
             It sucks to break down into small pieces. So paper money is born to try to solve these problems.</p>

        <p>The United States decides to tie the amount of dollars that exist to the amount of gold that exists.
            Until 1971. 
        </p>

        <p>In 1971, the United States was fighting in the Vietnam War.
            Imagine you are the president of a really big country, the most powerful in the world, currently at war.
            You are given a printer that can make UNLIMITED money.
            Instead of running around door to door collecting money from your own citizens,
            you can just create a shit ton of money instantly that can pay for tanks, bombs, weapons, and soldiers.
            To fund the war, are you going door to door asking for tax money or using the infinity printer?
        </p>

        <p>Yeah, you guessed it, we used that machine (and still lost). What is that machine exactly?
            It's the dollar not tied to anything, therefore those in control of the financial system can create infinite amounts of money for free.
            And in fact, we haven't stopped using it 50+ years later.</p>

        <p>What exactly is the consequence of this?
        The value of money across time from year to year continues to lose its value at faster rates.
        If everyone knows the money sucks and will keep being worth less, people avoid saving in it. 
        Then things that aren't meant to really be money, such as homes, end up getting inflated in value.
        It's harder to create homes than it is money, so it keeps its value.
        But homes should be meant to be lived in, not meant to be ways to maintain your wealth. </p>

        <p>In 1971, the year we created this infinite printing machine, 
            you could buy the average home in about 2.5 years of the average income at the time.
            So if you were making $8000 per year, a home cost about $20,000. Today?
        The average salary is about $40,000 and the average new home is nearly $400,000,
         that is 10 years, or 4 times more difficult than 1971.
        </p>
        
        <p>Again, gold is just a dumb metal. It's not special. 
            It is however better than money being decided arbitrarily with an infinite money printing machine.</p>

        <p>So wtf does this have to do with Bitcoin? EVERYTHING.</p>

        <h2 id="h2Bitcoin">Bitcoin, the Best Money</h2> <img id="btc" src="bitcoin.png" alt="Bitcoin logo">

        <aside>Refer back to the traits of money chart. Look at the all the different traits Bitcoin is superior
            than gold and fiat at. 
        </aside>
        
            <h4>Verifiable</h4>
                <p>Sending or accepting a payment through a Bitcoin wallet will always tell the truth.
                Gold can be fake all too often, dollars can be counterfeited.</p>
           
            <h4>Portable</h4> 
                <p>Bitcoin simultaneously exists everywhere and nowhere. It can be sent everywhere.
                You can travel anywhere in the world with it and no one would know.
                For those escaping war torn 3rd world countries, or countries with tyrannical
                governments, this is the difference between surviving and dying.</p>

                This cannot be done with gold and their bank accounts are too often shut down in these places.
                The proliferation of a currency like Bitcoin is truly a human right.</p>
            
            <h4>Durable</h4> 
                <p>Hard wallets can be lost or broken. Storing it online can be hacked if you're not careful, just like dollars.
                However, if you take it to the extreme, you can literally memorize your password and it's unbreakable.
                Gold is good here, it's hard to damage. </p>
            
            <h4>Divisible</h4> 
                <p>Bitcoin can be broken down into hundreds of millions of pieces. 
                Fractions of a cent can be sent. This will enable use cases and micropayments that have not been possible.
                Obviously, gold is a giant failure here and a reason why it's not acceptable as the best money in our digital world.
                </p>

            <h4>Scarce</h4>
            <img id="waterBottle" src="waterbottleleak.png" alt="Illustration of a leaking water bottle representing inflation">
                <p>The amount of Bitcoins that will ever exist is 21 million.
                It won't change, it's a fixed amount, and we know the exact supply at all times.
                This is a HUGE DEAL. </p>
                <p>Imagine a water bottle that instead of storing water it stores your wealth 
                    with a tiny hole in it that leaks out 2% of it per year. That's gold.
                    Slowly, that water bottle will be empty over time. It will be hard to notice on a daily time frame.
                </p>
                <p>Imagine a water bottle with a 5-10% hole in it. That's effectively dollars
                    and other first world currencies during a typical year. You will notice this leak.
                    Look at the last two years.
                    Look at the increasing price of foods and homes. This is the experience on the high side.
                </p>
                <p>How about third world countries? What's their water bottle like? 
                    Some of them print more than 100% of their entire currency supply
                    history in a single year. This analogy breaks here because these people
                    basically don't even get a fucking water bottle. They are putting water in a mud hole and in a little bit of time, it's gone.
                </p>
                <p>How about Bitcoin's water bottle? 0. There isn't a hole. It doesn't exist, because you
                    can't create more Bitcoin. All that water... 1 year, 10 years, and even 100 years from now,
                    will hold the same amount of water as it holds today. It's an indestructable water bottle.
                </p>
                <p>In the poorest, worst countries in the world, Bitcoin is their only option. 
                It's Bitcoin to save and on a shorter time frame, stablecoins based on the United States dollar. 
                The governments of these countries are too tempted and 
                corruputed by their infinite money printers and getting to press that print button.</p>
                <p>It's important to remember those in control of the money printer believe they're doing the right thing.
                    They think if they just had a little more money, they could fix the housing problem of their country. That they could buy more food.
                    That they could dig themselves out of the hole they're in. It's too painful to lose this power for many of them. </p>

                <p>But when these goverments force their currency on people and ban Bitcoin and stablecoins, 
                they are saying their citizens don't have the right to save their money at all. 
                A life cannot be built on such a system. How can you save up and buy a home?</p>
            <h4>Established History</h4>
                <p>If we are able to establish in the minds of people that Bitcoin is better money, how come many 
                    are still seemingly irrationally skeptical to the idea? 
                    We tend to put a lot of importance on how long something has been around.
                </p>
                <p>The last few generations have always grown up with gold and fiat currencies. It's always felt normal and a part of their life.
                    Today, the overwhelming majority of the world still haven't ever made a single Bitcoin transaction. It feels very new.
                </p>
                <p>However, it doesn't take too long for something to become established. Most people can't imagine a world without the internet
                    any longer. Most people have only really been using it for about 15 years.
                </p>
                <p>Bitcoin reaching an established history into the minds of the majority and feels like it's always been a part of our lives probably
                    happens at the end of this decade. But, it's important to understand whether it's 2011 or 2030, Bitcoin is the the same opportunity
                it's always been.  </p>
            <h4>Censorship Resistance</h4>
                <p>In the 1930s, the United States enacted a law that forced everyone to hand over their gold to the government. It wasn't until 1974
                        that people could own gold again. </p>
                <p>Fiat currencies and censorship are best friends. Many countries are currently working on central bank digital currencies
                    that will allow every single transaction to be monitored. Those in truly authoritarian countries will 
                    be banned, punished, and taken advantage of if they do anything at all that their government doesn't like.
                </p>
                <p>In China, there are people who are unable to leave their home at all due to covid. If they go to a McDonalds, their card 
                    will be declined if their covid status is unacceptable. They can't order food. I don't think 
                    anyone should be declined food and be left to starve.
                </p>
                <p>Think of the political party that you dislike most. Now imagine them in power, knowing you've given to causes against this party 
                    or even just said something negative about them online.
                    Do you think there's a chance you might not get the same treatment you otherwise would?
                    This is the world that exists
                    when all financial transactions can be controlled. This scenario laid out already affects millions of people around the world.
                </p>
                <p>With Bitcoin, anyone can download a wallet for free on their phone. Many transactions don't even require an internet
                    connection anymore. When you download a wallet, you don't need ID or any type of verification. 
                    The Bitcoin network guarantees you can send and receive to whatever addresses you want. No one is capable
                    of blocking or reversing your transaction.
                </p>
                <p>Imagine having to leave a country and you want to bring what you can with you. Do you think you can cross a border with gold? In most countries you can't.
                    How about cash? Most countries will confiscate it. This happens every day. Millions of people unable to move with their life savings.
                </p>
                <p>How about with Bitcoin? You could literally take with you billions of dollars of Bitcoin across any border in the world and no one would have a single clue.
                    How would anyone ever know? You can create infinite wallets and access them at any time. You can delete the app on your phone and download it whenever
                    you're safe to access it again.
                </p>
                <p>Bitcoin is a moral imperative for people around the world that need money to work in the hardest of times.</p>
                <h4>Unforgeable Costliness</h4>
                <p>Bitcoin uses energy to produce Bitcoin. If a Bitcoin could be created for free, anyone would be capable of co-opting the network.
                    The lack of an energy requirement could make it easier for attackers to perform malicious activities on the network,
                    such as double spending or denial of service attacks. These types of attacks can potentially harm the integrity and
                    security of the network, and the energy requirement helps to prevent them by making them too costly to be worth the
                    effort.
                    
                    Overall, the energy requirement for bitcoin mining serves as an important security and stability mechanism for the
                    bitcoin network. Without it, the network would likely be much less secure and less able to maintain the value of the
                    currency. </p>
                <p>This is a feature for gold too, but only in terms of it maintaining its value, not for actual applications of gold.
                    Think about it. There are use cases to gold, it's important in building certain technology like computers.
                     Having more gold and cheaper gold
                    would be a great thing for actually using it for these purposes.
                </p>
                <p>This is also why it's a great thing that Bitcoin doesn't have physical "intrinsic" value. Bitcoin exists as money only,
                    so it doesn't have to compete with other physical use cases that are better off if the price is cheaper. The price of Bitcoin
                    could reach 1 million dollars and still be just as useful as it is today. Gold would be hoarded and unavailable for use 
                    in tech.
                </p>
                <p>Fiat can be created infinitely for free and is all the time by all countries in the world. There is nothing tying the creation of
                    dollars to anything, therefore it is very easy for people to create more of them. And so they do.
                </p>
                <h4>Openly Programmable</h4>
                <p>This a a feature that is new to money thanks to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is open source, meaning that anyone
                    is allowed to contribute to the network and produce new updates with better features, making it faster,
                    safer, better wallets, whatever they wish to create that users want.
                </p>
                <p>Dollars and fiat currencies are closed source. No one is capable of editing or changing the properties of their money
                    besides those who are in control of it. 
                </p>
                <p>Open source invites the best people in the world to come in and make change if they wish. And simultaneously, it allows
                    its own users to decide what they like and what they don't want.
                </p>
                <p>Closed source doesn't get the best minds. Only the ones in charge. And you're given what you're given as a user. You don't
                    have any say. 
                </p>
                <p>Now think about the long term implications of closed source technologies versus open sourced technologies.
                    One is constantly reiterating on itself, with the best minds motivated to create to give people exactly what they want. These technologies
                    are essentially unstoppable.The same level of inspiration, drive and excitement to build and create new things for closed source naturally pales
                    in comparison to that of open source by design. </p>
                <p>Money is getting faster, cheaper to send, and more open every day in Bitcoin. Dollars remain the exact same. </p>
                <h4>Decentralized</h4>
                <p>All of these properties of Bitcoin couldn't exist without its ability to be decentralized.
                </p>
                <p>Centralized means everything is under control by a singlar entity. They get to make all the changes. All the edits. It's god mode.
                    They have all the power. And they tend to have a singlar point of weakness/vulnerability. 
                    Imagine robbing a bank vault. If you're trying to attack it, you just go for the vault.
                     That is an example of money that is centralized to a single location.
                </p>
                <p>Decentralized is as if there is no bank vault. You need to go door to door to rob everyone. But in the case of Bitcoin,
                    not only do you have to go door to door, you have to simultaneously go door to door of 51% of everyone that goes to that bank. 
                </p>
                <p>With millions of Bitcoin miners and nodes all of over the world, many of them anonymous, there is not a single possible way to ever attack
                    the actual Bitcoin network. It is truly an impossible task. No way to take over the network and make changes or edits.
                </p>
                <p>In the case of the vault, this is exactly the problem with gold. Yes, gold can exist outside of vaults, but that's almost always where 
                    it ends up, especially for goverments with their reserves. And then we fall back into the problem where gold can be confiscated if they're left in these vaults.

                <h2>What About the Bitcoin Price?</h2>
                <p>The Bitcoin price is roughly a reflection of the adoption rate of Bitcoin. As more people
                    store more money in Bitcoin, the price will rise since there is less Bitcoin available. 
                    It is slightly more nuanced than this, but that is the easiest way to think about it.
                    If you believe more people will continue to use and save in Bitcoin, then you believe the price will go up.
                </p>
                <p>There are 21 million Bitcoins. The amount of people in the world estimated to be millionaires are 56,100,000.
                    So can each millionaire own 1 Bitcoin? No! They can't get even get to half a Bitcoin. So if much of the world
                ends up adopting Bitcoin, the price of a single Bitcoin has the potential to be worth a very significant
                amount of money. </p>
                <p>We've spent a lot of time comparing Bitcoin to gold since both are used as money and stores of value.
                    As I'm writing this in December 2022, all the gold in the world is currently worth about 11 trillion.
                    All the Bitcoin in the world? About 320 billion.
                </p>
                <p>If all the Bitcoins that exist were to be worth the same amount of all the gold in the world today, (11 trillion / 320 billion),
                    that means the price of 1 Bitcoin would be worth about 34.375 times what it's worth today at a price of
                    $575,000 per Bitcoin! The following amounts are dollars invested and what that would be worth if it matches gold's current market cap:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>$1 = $34.38</li>
                    <li>$10 = $343.75</li>
                    <li>$100 = $3437.50</li>
                    <li>$1000 = $34,375</li>
                    <li>$10,000 = $343,750</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While there is no guarantee this happens, this is possible. And this is only if
                    Bitcoin just matches gold in their total values. As I've shared throughout this article, I think Bitcoin 
                    is better than gold in every single possible way as money and a store of value, so it is my personal belief
                    that a Bitcoin price of $575,000 is entirely realistic.

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Is math more honest than people? If so, you agree with the organizational structure of Bitcoin.</p>
                <p>Should money be available for everyone, regardless of location, skin color, race, sex, gender, or religion? 
                    If so, you agree with Bitcoin's policy. Many countries around the world don't agree.</p>
                <p>Should everyone be guaranteed money that maintains its value and won't get destroyed?
                    If so, you agree with Bitcoin's scarcity and disagree with a government's ability to print money.
                </p>
                <p>Should everyone always have access to their money? Should they be able to travel anywhere with it?
                    If so, you agree with Bitcoin and not any current banking system.
                </p>
                <p>Regardless of whether or not you personally agree or if the government agrees, the Bitcoin network agrees. 
                    Governments may agree and never enact such terrible policies that violate human rights
                    in respect to financial services. But the ability for the Bitcoin network to do so is impossible.
                    Bitcoin can't be evil. Goverment currencies must be trusted not to do evil.
                </p>
                <p>Bitcoin is the natural evolution of money. Its adoption will be Darwinian in nature, 
                    as those who find themselves in situations where their savings are being destroyed,
                    stolen from then, taken away from them, will choose to adopt it out of necessity.</p>
                     
                 <p>Central bank digital currencies will not be borderless, they'll require a lot of personal information to sign up
                    that will exclude people, they will be limited in where they can be used and sent. They will put time limits
                    on using your own money. People will adopt an open currency like Bitcoin because it is simply better in every possible way.
