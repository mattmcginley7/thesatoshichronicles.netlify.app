                <h2 class="blog-title">Why Bitcoin Changes the Housing Market</h2>
            </header>
            <aside>How strong money makes homes cheaper, not more expensive</aside>

            <p>Most people are taught that buying a house is one of the best investments you can make.</p>
            <p>“Real estate always goes up.”<br>“Land is scarce.”<br>“Housing is the safest place to store wealth.”</p>

            <p>But very few people stop to ask why housing became an investment in the first place.</p>

            <p>The answer has much less to do with homes—and much more to do with money.</p>

            <p>This article explains, in simple terms, why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Housing prices keep rising</li>
                <li>Real estate became a store of value</li>
                <li>Bitcoin changes that equation</li>
                <li>And why, over the long run, strong money leads to cheaper housing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>1. What money is supposed to do (in simple terms)</h2>
            <p>Money has three main jobs:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Medium of exchange – something we use to trade with</li>
                <li>Unit of account – something we price things in</li>
                <li>Store of value – something that holds purchasing power over time</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The third job—store of value—is the most important for this discussion.</p>

            <p>A good store of value means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can save today</li>
                <li>And buy roughly the same amount (or more) in the future</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If money fails at this job, people are forced to find other things to store their wealth in.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>2. Why modern money is bad at storing value</h2>
            <p>Today’s money is fiat money, which means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is created by governments and central banks</li>
                <li>There is no fixed supply</li>
                <li>More can always be printed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When more money is created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each existing dollar buys less</li>
                <li>Prices rise over time</li>
                <li>Savings lose purchasing power</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is what we call inflation, but at its core it simply means:</p>

            <p>Money becomes less valuable the longer you hold it.</p>

            <p>Because of this, people don’t want to save in cash.</p>

            <p>So they ask a different question:</p>

            <p>“What can I put my money into that won’t lose value?”</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>3. Why people turned houses into investments</h2>
            <p>When money stopped working as a store of value, people looked for harder things—things that were harder to create than money itself.</p>

            <p>Real estate became one of the most popular choices.</p>

            <p>Why?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can’t instantly create land</li>
                <li>Houses take time and effort to build</li>
                <li>Property feels tangible and “real”</li>
                <li>It historically rises faster than inflation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So homes slowly stopped being just places to live and started becoming:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Savings accounts</li>
                <li>Retirement plans</li>
                <li>Wealth storage vehicles</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is a crucial point:</p>

            <p>Housing prices didn’t explode because homes became better.<br>They exploded because money became worse.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>4. The hidden cost of using homes as savings</h2>
            <p>Using real estate as a store of value comes with serious downsides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homes physically wear down<br>Roofs, plumbing, appliances—all decay over time.</li>
                <li>They are expensive to hold<br>Property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs.</li>
                <li>They are illiquid<br>You can’t sell a bedroom if you need cash.</li>
                <li>They are tied to governments and rules<br>Zoning laws, rent control, taxes, regulations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Yet people accept these costs because the alternative—holding cash—is worse.</p>

            <p>That’s not a sign real estate is great money.</p>

            <p>It’s a sign that money is broken.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>5. Bitcoin introduces something new: strong money</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is different because it fixes the store-of-value problem at the money level.</p>

            <p>Here’s what makes Bitcoin unique, in plain language:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed supply<br>There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. No one can change that.</li>
                <li>No physical decay<br>Bitcoin doesn’t rot, rust, or wear out.</li>
                <li>No property taxes or maintenance<br>You don’t pay yearly costs just to hold it.</li>
                <li>Easy to move and divide<br>You can send any amount, anywhere, at any time.</li>
                <li>Harder than real estate<br>We can build more houses.<br>We cannot create more Bitcoin.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin is not just an investment—it is a better form of money.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>6. What happens when money is harder than houses</h2>
            <p>This is the key shift.</p>

            <p>For most of modern history:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Money was easy to create</li>
                <li>Houses were hard to create</li>
            </ul>

            <p>So wealth flowed into houses.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin flips that relationship:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bitcoin is extremely hard to create</li>
                <li>Houses are comparatively easy to create</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When that happens, wealth flows into money instead.</p>

            <p>This doesn’t mean everyone sells their home.</p>

            <p>It means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Investors no longer need homes to protect their savings</li>
                <li>Fewer people buy houses just to store wealth</li>
                <li>The extra “investment demand” for housing slowly fades</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Markets are set at the margin.<br>You don’t need everyone to change—just the next buyer.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>7. The idea of “monetary premium” (explained simply)</h2>
            <p>Today, a home’s price includes two parts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use value – shelter, location, comfort</li>
                <li>Monetary premium – people bidding it up as a place to store money</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Bitcoin competes only for the second part.</p>

            <p>As people store value in Bitcoin instead of property:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The monetary premium shrinks</li>
                <li>Prices become more tied to wages and rents</li>
                <li>Homes stop rising endlessly in price</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is how housing becomes more affordable—without destroying housing itself.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>8. A simple thought experiment</h2>
            <p>Imagine a world with perfect money.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can’t print more of it</li>
                <li>It gains value over time</li>
                <li>Saving is rewarded</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In that world:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You wouldn’t need a house as an investment</li>
                <li>You’d buy a house because you want to live there</li>
                <li>Better homes would become cheaper over time</li>
                <li>Just like TVs, computers, and phones</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Housing only became “an investment” because money failed.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin gives us the first real alternative.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>9. Why this change happens slowly (and realistically)</h2>
            <p>This is not an overnight revolution.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People won’t abandon real estate</li>
                <li>Homes still provide shelter</li>
                <li>Some investors will always want rental income</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But even small shifts matter.</p>

            <p>If investors allocate 10–20% of what would have gone into property into Bitcoin instead:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Less pressure on housing prices</li>
                <li>Fewer bidding wars</li>
                <li>More supply available for people who actually want to live there</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That’s how systems change—gradually, then suddenly.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>10. The bigger picture</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin isn’t about getting rich quick.</p>

            <p>It’s about restoring something we lost:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Money that actually works</li>
                <li>Savings that don’t decay</li>
                <li>An economy where productivity makes life cheaper, not more expensive</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a world with strong money:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Homes are homes again</li>
                <li>Savings are savings again</li>
                <li>And wealth doesn’t need to hide inside walls and roofs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin doesn’t destroy housing.</p>

            <p>It frees housing from having to be money.</p>

                <p class="blog-meta">Category: Mining &amp; energy</p>
                <h2 class="blog-title">Why Bitcoin Using Energy Is a Feature, Not a Bug</h2>
            </header>
            <aside>A deep research case for proof-of-work, energy, and monetary rights</aside>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Introduction: the energy narrative is backward</h2>
            <p>For many people, their entire view of Bitcoin mining begins and ends with one sentence:<br>“Bitcoin uses a lot of energy.”</p>

            <p>From there, the conclusion feels obvious—it must be bad. Wasteful. Environmentally destructive. A technological mistake.</p>

            <p>But this framing skips the most important question entirely:</p>

            <p>What is that energy actually doing?</p>

            <p>Energy use alone tells us nothing. Civilization itself is the story of converting energy into coordination, security, and prosperity. Roads, hospitals, food systems, the internet, and the global banking system all exist because energy is continuously consumed to maintain them.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin is no different—except that its energy use is explicit, measurable, and voluntary, rather than hidden behind inflation, taxation, or institutional opacity.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>1. Why Bitcoin must be tied to energy at all</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin is secured by Proof-of-Work, a system that deliberately anchors digital value to physical reality.</p>

            <p>In traditional systems, ownership is enforced by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Governments</li>
                <li>Courts</li>
                <li>Police</li>
                <li>Militaries</li>
                <li>Financial intermediaries</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These systems all require energy—massive amounts of it—but the costs are externalized and hidden.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin internalizes those costs.</p>

            <p>To alter Bitcoin’s ledger, an attacker must expend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real capital</li>
                <li>Real hardware</li>
                <li>Real electricity</li>
                <li>Continuously, not just once</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This makes fraud and censorship physically expensive, not just logically prohibited.</p>

            <p>Energy is not an accident here.<br>It is the mechanism that makes Bitcoin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neutral</li>
                <li>Permissionless</li>
                <li>Resistant to political capture</li>
                <li>Credible as long-term property</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Without energy, Bitcoin would simply be another database controlled by administrators.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>2. How much energy does Bitcoin mining actually use?</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin’s energy use is often discussed vaguely, but credible estimates exist.</p>

            <p>The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance maintains the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), the most widely cited independent model.</p>

            <p>Recent estimates place global Bitcoin mining electricity usage roughly in the range of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>~120–170 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, depending on assumptions and network conditions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That is not trivial—but it is also not uniquely large in a world that consumes over 180,000 TWh annually.</p>

            <p>The key insight is not the absolute number.<br>It’s what kind of energy Bitcoin uses and how it responds to price signals.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>3. Mining is economically self-regulating by design</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin mining is one of the most competitive industries on earth. That competition creates powerful incentives.</p>

            <p>Energy price discipline</p>

            <p>Electricity is the dominant operating cost.<br>If power is expensive, miners lose money and shut down.</p>

            <p>This forces mining toward:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abundant energy</li>
                <li>Underutilized energy</li>
                <li>Otherwise wasted energy</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Mining does not thrive where energy is scarce or needed most by households—it thrives where energy has no better buyer.</p>

            <p>Location-dependent and location-independent</p>

            <p>This combination is unique.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Location-dependent: miners must go where energy is cheapest.</li>
                <li>Location-independent: mined hashes can be produced anywhere with an internet connection.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That allows Bitcoin to monetize energy that cannot easily be transported, such as remote hydro, curtailed wind, or stranded gas.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>4. Bitcoin miners as buyers of last resort</h2>
            <p>Many power grids face a structural mismatch:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generation is built for peak demand</li>
                <li>Actual demand fluctuates constantly</li>
                <li>Excess energy is often curtailed or wasted</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin miners solve this by acting as buyers of last resort.</p>

            <p>Underutilized grids</p>

            <p>In regions with excess capacity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mining provides immediate baseline demand</li>
                <li>Improves the economics of power infrastructure</li>
                <li>Encourages further grid investment</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Overloaded grids</p>

            <p>When grids are stressed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electricity prices spike</li>
                <li>Mining becomes unprofitable</li>
                <li>Miners shut off automatically</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This behavior has been observed in markets like Texas, where miners participate in demand-response programs coordinated with ERCOT.</p>

            <p>Mining is not rigid load—it is price-responsive load, which modern grids desperately need.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>5. Flare gas and methane mitigation</h2>
            <p>One of the strongest environmental use cases for Bitcoin mining involves methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO₂ over short time horizons.</p>

            <p>The problem</p>

            <p>Oil and gas operations frequently produce methane that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cannot be economically transported</li>
                <li>Is flared or vented on site</li>
                <li>Contributes significantly to emissions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Bitcoin mining solution</p>

            <p>Portable mining units can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be deployed directly at flare sites</li>
                <li>Convert methane into electricity</li>
                <li>Use that electricity to secure the Bitcoin network</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Multiple studies show that combusting methane for power generation is materially better than venting it, and in many cases better than inefficient flaring.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin mining creates economic incentive to mitigate methane that would otherwise be wasted.</p>

            <p>Few industries can turn an environmental liability into a monetizable improvement.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>6. Renewable energy and Bitcoin mining are structurally aligned</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin mining does not need to be “green by intention” to trend green by economics.</p>

            <p>Renewable energy sources tend to have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High upfront capital costs</li>
                <li>Very low marginal costs</li>
                <li>Intermittent output</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin mining:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can turn on and off instantly</li>
                <li>Can operate in remote locations</li>
                <li>Does not require proximity to population centers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This makes mining a natural complement to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wind farms with curtailment</li>
                <li>Solar farms with midday oversupply</li>
                <li>Hydroelectric plants with seasonal excess</li>
            </ul>

            <p>According to survey-based research from Cambridge, a majority of Bitcoin mining electricity now comes from sustainable sources, including renewables and nuclear, with coal usage declining sharply.</p>

            <p>This is not ideology—it is cost minimization at work.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>7. “But it uses more energy than Christmas lights and dryers”</h2>
            <p>This comparison often circulates in oversimplified form, and it deserves clarity.</p>

            <p>Household activities like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decorative holiday lighting</li>
                <li>Clothes dryers</li>
                <li>Always-on consumer electronics</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Collectively consume tens of terawatt-hours per year in the United States alone.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin’s energy use is comparable in scale, but the more important comparison is not raw consumption—it is value per unit of energy.</p>

            <p>Society does not question energy spent on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Entertainment</li>
                <li>Convenience</li>
                <li>Inefficiency</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin’s energy expenditure secures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A global, censorship-resistant monetary system</li>
                <li>Immutable digital property rights</li>
                <li>A settlement network independent of political authority</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The question is not whether Bitcoin uses energy.<br>The question is whether this outcome is worth the energy it consumes.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>8. Energy, property rights, and inflation</h2>
            <p>For billions of people, inflation is not a theoretical concern.</p>

            <p>Currency debasement, capital controls, and confiscation are lived realities.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A fixed monetary supply</li>
                <li>Ownership without permission</li>
                <li>Settlement without intermediaries</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Historically, property rights have always required energy to enforce:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Armies</li>
                <li>Courts</li>
                <li>Police</li>
                <li>Bureaucracies</li>
                <li>Financial institutions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin replaces coercive enforcement with economic enforcement.</p>

            <p>Instead of trusting institutions, users trust math, cryptography, and energy.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>9. Bitcoin internalizes its security costs</h2>
            <p>This is a crucial and often overlooked point.</p>

            <p>Traditional monetary systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Externalize security costs</li>
                <li>Fund enforcement through inflation, taxation, and debt</li>
                <li>Hide the true cost of monetary control</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bitcoin does the opposite.</p>

            <p>Its security cost:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is transparent</li>
                <li>Is voluntary</li>
                <li>Is paid by those who value the system</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There is no pretense that security is free.</p>

            <p>That honesty alone makes Bitcoin fundamentally different.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: energy is the point</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin does not use energy because it is inefficient.<br>It uses energy because anything that resists corruption must be expensive to corrupt.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin turns energy into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monetary integrity</li>
                <li>Property rights</li>
                <li>Global neutrality</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a world where energy is already spent enforcing far less transparent systems, Bitcoin’s tradeoff is not only reasonable—it is elegant.</p>

            <p>The real question is not whether Bitcoin uses energy.</p>

            <p>The real question is whether securing human monetary freedom is worth it.</p>

            <p>For millions of people already using Bitcoin to escape inflation and censorship, the answer is clear.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">Roll or Die You Bet I'm a Rider - A Guide To How I Think About How Much To Invest</h2>
            </header>

            <p>Imagine You're flipping a coin; heads or tails. Each has a 50% outcome. If you bet $1, you can win double your money, $2. If you lose, you lose your dollar. If the odds are 50% and your winnings are double, this is ultimately a pointless game to be played. Over enough time, you'll just break even.</p>

            <p>What if we flipped a coin, but now instead you win 10x your money if heads, and still lose whatever you gambled with? The odds are still 50%, however, your return on one side is much greater. Let's play it out for 10 flips, what would happen with $1 each flip:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tails: -$1</li>
                <li>Heads: +$10</li>
                <li>Tails: -$1</li>
                <li>Heads: +$10</li>
                <li>Tails: -$1</li>
                <li>Heads: +$10</li>
                <li>Tails: -$1</li>
                <li>Heads: +$10</li>
                <li>Tails: -$1</li>
                <li>Heads: +$10</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You won $50, and lost $5. Your total winnings are $45. Your average return per coin toss are 4.5 times your initial investment! This type of game should be played very often if it existed.</p>

            <p>Now the question is how much should someone bet to play this game? Should you bet everything you have? Go into debt for it? Remember, although the returns are positive per flip, there's still a 50% chance you lose everything. No matter how amazing the returns are, risking everything I would consider to be dangerous and not worth playing the game.</p>

            <p>On the other side, there is most certainly too small a number. If you're a millionaire and you were offered this opportunity, betting only $10 is simply just not worth it. This is cowardly, and not taking advantage of the amazing situation at hand.</p>

            <p>This is an age old question that investors have to think about. There are many variables to a game like this, and everyone has their own risk tolerance. Everyone has different comfort levels, but it is good to establish in your mind what is too much and what is too little. Something that effectively splits the difference of "don't be a bitch" and "don't lose it all" is probably that place.</p>

            <p>Now, I personally consider Bitcoin to be flipping a coin that lands on heads 90% of the time that has at minimum 10x returns in its relatively longer term future. These odds  are purely subjective on my part, but they are based on my understanding of Bitcoin and the chances that I see it succeeding.</p>

            <p>It also isn't decided instantly, it's a game whose odds change slightly every day so you can always reevaluate at any time.</p>

            <p>But, if you are a serious investor, throwing $100 at this isn't correct. Investing all your life's savings, mortgage and bill money when you have a family and you can't handle the day to day volatility isn't right either. But, there is a right number for you, where you can play this game in a way that will change your life and not damage it either.</p>

            <aside>Saving in Dollars is Dead</aside>
            <img src="BTCBurningCash.png" alt="Burning cash" class="blog-image">

            <p>Often, you will hear people are told they need to invest their money in order for it to grow. Why is that? It's because saving in dollars or any other government currency is DESIGNED to lose value over time.</p>
            <p>The way it loses value is very insidious. The total amount of dollars you have remain the same, but how much everything around you costs seems to be going up. So if you had $10,000 dollars in 2020 that you could put towards a home and now homes are up 50%, that 10,000 is now only buying you $5,000 worth of that same home.</p>
            <p>Why doesn't the government stop this? Why don't they guarantee the value of the dollar remains the same over time? Well, that would mean they can't inflate the money supply by creating dollars out of thin air to pay for their spending. Sorry, but funding everything the government wants matters more to them. Social security, health care, public services, military spending, this is the cost to have these things!</p>
            <p>Currently, the government owes 37 trillion dollars that must be paid out to fund all these different things. With this comes interest, and the interest payments are so large that they consume a significant portion of the budget, leaving less for other important services.</p>
            <p>Imagine you make 45,000 per year, yet you spend $60,000 per year. And you keep borrowing more money to cover the difference. Eventually, you reach a point where your debt is so high that you can't keep up with the payments. This is exactly what is happening to the U.S. government.</p>
            <p>So, do you want to be on the hook and pay the consequences for someone whose financial decisions have led to this situation? Because you no longer have to! Enter Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin has no debt. It's structurally designed to just exist without the need for borrowing or creating money out of thin air. There literally is no ability to create more Bitcoin. In comparison, the M2 Global Money Supply (just a fancy way of saying all how much more money is being created out of thin air in totality around the world) continues to increase for ever and ever at accelerating rates. That just means they keep making their currency worth less and less in that insidious way I mentioned earlier.</p>
            <img src="M2Bitcoin.png" alt="M2 money supply compared to Bitcoin" class="blog-image">
            <aside>The yellow line you can think of as the creation of all the brand new money in the world. The other line is the Bitcoin price, which rises as new money is being created.</aside>
            <p>Imagine Bitcoin is in equal footing on all the different properties that make it money as the dollar in every other aspect. Why on earth would you choose to save your wealth in the dollar that inflates forever versus the one that cannot inflate no matter what? This is why the Bitcoin price keeps going up!</p>
            <p>This is becoming obvious now. Just a few years ago, people felt like Bitcoin was just a strange digital curiosity. Now, it's clear that it's a legitimate alternative to traditional currencies.</p>
            <p>My call to action: Start thinking about your savings differently. Go learn about Bitcoin on your own and if you find out what I am saying is true, decide to hold some of your savings in Bitcoin instead of all in dollars. As times goes by and your confidence and understanding grows, so does the percentage of money you hold in Bitcoin relative to dollars.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">The Store of Value Wars: One Asset to Rule Them All</h2>
            </header>
            <aside>How Bitcoin stacks up against every other place to park your wealth</aside>

            <p>Money really only has two jobs: move value through space and keep value through time. We all grasp the first job because sending money is part of daily life. The second job—preserving purchasing power—is where the hidden damage happens. You can still hold the same stack of dollars, yet every item you want costs more because the supply of dollars keeps expanding.</p>

            <p>When prices rise, it is tempting to blame the coffee shop, the landlord, or the hospital. Competition keeps most businesses from gouging, though; the real culprit is that the money supply grows, so each dollar buys less. Imagine a town with $10 per person and apples priced at $1. If the money supply doubles, each person now has $20, and apples become $2 to keep the same share of purchasing power. The seller is not suddenly greedy—the money just became worth less.</p>

            <p>Here is the kicker: if no one could create more money, prices would naturally fall over time as technology makes producing and delivering goods cheaper. Better tools, richer soil, autonomous transport—each innovation lowers costs. In a fixed-supply money world, those efficiency gains flow to everyone as lower prices.</p>

            <p>The wealthy already know this game. They avoid holding cash by buying assets: gold, commodities, bonds, stocks, real estate, and increasingly Bitcoin. Every asset comes with trade-offs: volatility, exposure to management decisions, liquidity limits, or reliance on market hours. The question is whether one asset best fulfills the goal of maintaining and growing value through time.</p>

            <h2>Designing the perfect store of value</h2>
            <p>To protect value across time, an asset needs a few core qualities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed supply:</strong> New units cannot be created at will. Bitcoin caps out at 21 million, enforced by its decentralized network. Gold supply grows every year, and new shares or new dollars can be issued whenever issuers decide.</li>
                <li><strong>User control:</strong> Holders must be able to custody and secure the asset themselves. Bitcoin allows self-custody with a phone or hardware wallet; stocks sit on exchanges that can gate access, and large amounts of gold are cumbersome to secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Always-on liquidity:</strong> You should be able to use or sell it anytime. Real estate can take months to sell, and stocks trade only during market hours. Bitcoin trades 24/7/365 globally.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Across the world, assets compete to be the preferred vault for wealth: real estate and bonds sit in the hundreds of trillions, equities hover around a hundred trillion, and gold commands tens of trillions. Bitcoin, the contender purpose-built as digital property with a hard cap, is still under two trillion.</p>

            <p>Markets are Darwinian. Over time, the assets with the strongest store-of-value traits rise to the top. If Bitcoin truly is the superior option, the flow of wealth toward it is only beginning. Those who recognize and act on that reality early are best positioned to benefit.</p>

            <p>On longer time frames, buying Bitcoin will likely always beat the dollar. Short term, anything is possible, but the correct approach to be successful in Bitcoin is to have a lot of patience and to invest money you have saved up, not bill money.</p>

            </header>
            <p>This is your safe place to ask the “obvious” Bitcoin questions. Every answer below is written to be direct, plain English, and free of jargon so you can build confidence in your understanding step by step.</p>

            <div class="qa-list">
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Is Bitcoin a scam?</h2>
                    <p>No, Bitcoin is not a scam. For decades, computer programmers have been trying to create a money that uses cryptography to secure it. The idea is if a currency can be created that no one can steal or control, a better system of money can exist. Bitcoin was the first successful one because Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, solved a famous computer science challenge called the Byzantine Generals Problem—how to get computers that do not trust each other to agree on the same truth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Can I only buy a whole Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>Fortunately, you can buy any amount of Bitcoin you want. You can own tiny fractions. If Bitcoin is $100,000, you could buy $100 worth, $10 worth, or even just a few cents worth and still participate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Where can I buy Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>You can buy Bitcoin on exchanges, where you trade your local currency for Bitcoin. Some of the most popular ones are Coinbase, Gemini, and Binance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Why should I buy Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>The shortest and simplest answer: Bitcoin is likely to become more valuable over time, while the currency you use today (dollars, euros, pesos, etc.) will likely buy less over time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Why is this?</h2>
                    <p>Money has certain properties—it should be scarce, secure, and easy to send and receive. Bitcoin is stronger than traditional currencies in each of these areas, so more people are choosing it for long-term savings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Isn’t Bitcoin volatile?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, Bitcoin is volatile. The price can swing significantly in a short time. Because of this, invest with a plan. Ask yourself, “If the price drops a lot tomorrow, will I still be okay?” If the answer is no, invest a smaller amount that lets you stay calm and patient for the long term.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>What if I want to sell?</h2>
                    <p>The same exchange that lets you buy Bitcoin will let you sell it back into your local currency when you decide to.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>When should I sell?</h2>
                    <p>Ask yourself: when will the money you are switching back into be better than Bitcoin? If you believe Bitcoin still offers stronger money properties, selling may not make sense yet.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>When should I buy?</h2>
                    <p>If the money you are currently using is not serving you as well as Bitcoin can, consider buying Bitcoin as soon as possible so that more of your savings live in the better form of money.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>I understand Bitcoin is better, but I still want to take some profit.</h2>
                    <p>It is your money and your Bitcoin, so always do what is best for you. Just know that selling for no clear reason is often met with regret later. Bitcoin has produced the greatest returns of any asset in history, and those who benefited most decided Bitcoin was their primary long-term money.</p>

                <h2 class="blog-title">STRC: The Yield Engine That Could Help Send Bitcoin Much Higher</h2>
            </header>

            <p>There are moments in investing where a new financial structure doesn’t just offer a better return — it changes the game.</p>
            <p>STRC (Stretch), a preferred stock issued by Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), is one of those moments.</p>

            <p>STRC isn’t just another Bitcoin-adjacent product. It’s a high-yield, low-volatility bridge between conservative capital and Bitcoin — and it may end up being one of the most powerful contributors to Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation.</p>

            <p>Let’s break down why.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>What Is STRC, Simply Explained</h2>
            <p>STRC is a yield-paying preferred stock that currently offers around 11% annualized return, paid monthly in cash.</p>

            <p>Key features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trades publicly like a stock</li>
                <li>No lockup period (buy or sell anytime)</li>
                <li>Designed to stay relatively stable in price</li>
                <li>Pays income similar to a bond, but at a much higher rate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This alone makes STRC compelling — but the reason it can exist is what makes it extraordinary.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Why STRC Beats Traditional “Safe” Investments</h2>
            <p>Consider the alternatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1-year U.S. Treasuries: ~3–4%</li>
                <li>Investment-grade bonds: low yield, high inflation risk</li>
                <li>Real estate: 8–12% if you’re skilled, leveraged, illiquid, and hands-on</li>
                <li>S&amp;P 500: ~8–10% expected long-term, but volatile year to year</li>
            </ul>

            <p>STRC offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>~11% yield</li>
                <li>Monthly cash payments</li>
                <li>Liquidity</li>
                <li>No tenants, no repairs, no lockups</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For anyone looking to park capital and earn income, STRC competes directly with bonds — and wins decisively.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>The Safety Mechanism Most People Miss</h2>
            <p>A common concern is: “What happens if Bitcoin crashes?”</p>

            <p>Here’s the critical detail:</p>
            <p>Strategy maintains a dedicated cash reserve specifically to pay STRC dividends — with roughly 20 months of coverage already funded.</p>

            <p>That means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Short-term Bitcoin volatility does not affect dividend payments</li>
                <li>No forced Bitcoin selling during drawdowns</li>
                <li>STRC income is insulated from near-term market swings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On top of that, Strategy is heavily overcollateralized with Bitcoin. This is not a fragile structure — it’s deliberately engineered to survive volatility.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>The Flywheel That Changes Everything</h2>
            <p>Here’s where STRC becomes bigger than just a great yield product.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Investors buy STRC for income</li>
                <li>Strategy uses the capital to buy Bitcoin</li>
                <li>Bitcoin appreciates over time</li>
                <li>Strategy easily covers the 11% payout</li>
                <li>Excess Bitcoin accrues to the balance sheet</li>
                <li>Confidence increases → more capital flows in</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This is a positive feedback loop.</p>

            <p>The key assumption is simple:</p>
            <p>Bitcoin must be worth more in the future.</p>

            <p>If you believe that, the entire structure works — and scales.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Why This Is a Win for Everyone</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>STRC holders get stable, high income</li>
                <li>Strategy acquires Bitcoin below its long-term value</li>
                <li>Bitcoin holders benefit from sustained, non-speculative demand</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is one of the rare cases in finance where incentives align across all participants.</p>

            <p>As Michael Saylor often argues, if Bitcoin compounds at ~20–30% over long periods, paying out 11% is not a cost — it’s leverage.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>STRC vs Bitcoin ETFs: Not Competitors, Partners</h2>
            <p>Bitcoin ETFs like iShares Bitcoin Trust bring in massive capital from investors who want pure price exposure.</p>

            <p>STRC brings in a completely different kind of money:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Yield-seeking</li>
                <li>Conservative</li>
                <li>Mandated capital that cannot buy Bitcoin directly</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Both funnels point in the same direction: more Bitcoin bought, held, and removed from circulation.</p>

            <p>ETFs legitimize Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>STRC institutionalizes it.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Why STRC Could Capture Enormous Capital</h2>
            <p>The global bond market is over $100 trillion.</p>

            <p>If even a small fraction of investors decide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“I’d rather earn 11% backed by Bitcoin than 3% in depreciating dollars”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That’s hundreds of billions — potentially trillions — of dollars seeking STRC-like structures.</p>

            <p>And every dollar that flows in ultimately becomes Bitcoin demand.</p>

            <p>⸻</p>

            <h2>Final Thought</h2>
            <p>STRC is not a speculative trade.</p>
            <p>It’s a structural shift.</p>

            <p>It allows conservative capital to participate in Bitcoin’s upside without volatility, while simultaneously accelerating Bitcoin’s adoption as a global monetary asset.</p>

            <p>If you believe Bitcoin will be worth more in the future, STRC is not something to ignore — it’s something to seriously consider as a core, cash-like holding in a Bitcoin-centric portfolio.</p>

            <p>Bitcoin doesn’t need everyone to buy it directly.</p>
            <p>It just needs systems that work.</p>

            <p>STRC is one of those systems.</p>
