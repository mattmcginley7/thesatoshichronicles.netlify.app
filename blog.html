            <h1>Bitcoin is the New Savings Account</h1>
            <aside>Saving in Dollars is Dead</aside>
            <img src="BTCBurningCash.png" alt="Burning cash" class="blog-image">

            <p>Often, you will hear people are told they need to invest their money in order for it to grow. Why is that? It's because saving in dollars or any other government currency is DESIGNED to lose value over time.</p>
            <p>The way it loses value is very insidious. The total amount of dollars you have remain the same, but how much everything around you costs seems to be going up. So if you had $10,000 dollars in 2020 that you could put towards a home and now homes are up 50%, that 10,000 is now only buying you $5,000 worth of that same home.</p>
            <p>Why doesn't the government stop this? Why don't they guarantee the value of the dollar remains the same over time? Well, that would mean they can't inflate the money supply by creating dollars out of thin air to pay for their spending. Sorry, but funding everything the government wants matters more to them. Social security, health care, public services, military spending, this is the cost to have these things!</p>
            <p>Currently, the government owes 37 trillion dollars that must be paid out to fund all these different things. With this comes interest, and the interest payments are so large that they consume a significant portion of the budget, leaving less for other important services.</p>
            <p>Imagine you make 45,000 per year, yet you spend $60,000 per year. And you keep borrowing more money to cover the difference. Eventually, you reach a point where your debt is so high that you can't keep up with the payments. This is exactly what is happening to the U.S. government.</p>
            <p>So, do you want to be on the hook and pay the consequences for someone whose financial decisions have led to this situation? Because you no longer have to! Enter Bitcoin.</p>
            <p>Bitcoin has no debt. It's structurally designed to just exist without the need for borrowing or creating money out of thin air. There literally is no ability to create more Bitcoin. In comparison, the M2 Global Money Supply (just a fancy way of saying all how much more money is being created out of thin air in totality around the world) continues to increase for ever and ever at accelerating rates. That just means they keep making their currency worth less and less in that insidious way I mentioned earlier.</p>
            <img src="M2Bitcoin.png" alt="M2 money supply compared to Bitcoin" class="blog-image">
            <aside>The yellow line you can think of as the creation of all the brand new money in the world. The other line is the Bitcoin price, which rises as new money is being created.</aside>
            <p>Imagine Bitcoin is in equal footing on all the different properties that make it money as the dollar in every other aspect. Why on earth would you choose to save your wealth in the dollar that inflates forever versus the one that cannot inflate no matter what? This is why the Bitcoin price keeps going up!</p>
            <p>This is becoming obvious now. Just a few years ago, people felt like Bitcoin was just a strange digital curiosity. Now, it's clear that it's a legitimate alternative to traditional currencies.</p>
        <p>My call to action: Start thinking about your savings differently. Go learn about Bitcoin on your own and if you find out what I am saying is true, decide to hold some of your savings in Bitcoin instead of all in dollars. As times goes by and your confidence and understanding grows, so does the percentage of money you hold in Bitcoin relative to dollars.</p>

            <p id="time-result"></p>
            <p>On longer time frames, buying Bitcoin will likely always beat the dollar. Short term, anything is possible, but the correct approach to be successful in Bitcoin is to have a lot of patience and to invest money you have saved up, not bill money.</p>

            <h1>The OFFICIAL “Is this is a dumb question” Q&amp;A for Bitcoin</h1>
            <p>This is your safe place to ask the “obvious” Bitcoin questions. Every answer below is written to be direct, plain English, and free of jargon so you can build confidence in your understanding step by step.</p>

            <div class="qa-list">
                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Is Bitcoin a scam?</h2>
                    <p>No, Bitcoin is not a scam. For decades, computer programmers have been trying to create a money that uses cryptography to secure it. The idea is if a currency can be created that no one can steal or control, a better system of money can exist. Bitcoin was the first successful one because Satoshi, the creator of Bitcoin, solved a famous computer science challenge called the Byzantine Generals Problem—how to get computers that do not trust each other to agree on the same truth.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Can I only buy a whole Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>Fortunately, you can buy any amount of Bitcoin you want. You can own tiny fractions. If Bitcoin is $100,000, you could buy $100 worth, $10 worth, or even just a few cents worth and still participate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Where can I buy Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>You can buy Bitcoin on exchanges, where you trade your local currency for Bitcoin. Some of the most popular ones are Coinbase, Gemini, and Binance.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Why should I buy Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>The shortest and simplest answer: Bitcoin is likely to become more valuable over time, while the currency you use today (dollars, euros, pesos, etc.) will likely buy less over time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Why is this?</h2>
                    <p>Money has certain properties—it should be scarce, secure, and easy to send and receive. Bitcoin is stronger than traditional currencies in each of these areas, so more people are choosing it for long-term savings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>Isn’t Bitcoin volatile?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, Bitcoin is volatile. The price can swing significantly in a short time. Because of this, invest with a plan. Ask yourself, “If the price drops a lot tomorrow, will I still be okay?” If the answer is no, invest a smaller amount that lets you stay calm and patient for the long term.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>What if I want to sell?</h2>
                    <p>The same exchange that lets you buy Bitcoin will let you sell it back into your local currency when you decide to.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>When should I sell?</h2>
                    <p>Ask yourself: when will the money you are switching back into be better than Bitcoin? If you believe Bitcoin still offers stronger money properties, selling may not make sense yet.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>When should I buy?</h2>
                    <p>If the money you are currently using is not serving you as well as Bitcoin can, consider buying Bitcoin as soon as possible so that more of your savings live in the better form of money.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="qa-item">
                    <h2>I understand Bitcoin is better, but I still want to take some profit.</h2>
                    <p>It is your money and your Bitcoin, so always do what is best for you. Just know that selling for no clear reason is often met with regret later. Bitcoin has produced the greatest returns of any asset in history, and those who benefited most decided Bitcoin was their primary long-term money.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="qa-closing">Keep asking questions, keep learning, and move at the pace that lets you sleep well at night.</p>
