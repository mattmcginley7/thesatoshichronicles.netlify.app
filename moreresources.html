        <h2>Andreas Antonopoulos</h2>
        <a href="aantonop.com"><span>Andreas' Official Website</span></a>
        <p>"Andreas M. Antonopoulos is a best-selling author, speaker, educator, and highly sought after expert in Bitcoin and open
        blockchain technologies. He is known for making complex subjects easy to understand and highlighting both the positive
        and negative impacts these technologies can have on our global societies. As an educator, his mission is to educate as
        many people as possible, in as many places as possible, in as many languages as possible, about the historical,
        technological, and socio-economic impacts of Bitcoin and open blockchain technologies."</p>

        <p>My personal experience in first learning Bitcoin and its importance was primarily shaped by Andreas
            and his talks on YouTube. I feel incredibly fortunate discovering him and not someone else in the beginning.
            Bitcoin is not an easy topic to understand, especially as a beginner, so having the right educator is the difference
            between getting it or thinking this is some weird version of PayPal.
        </p>
        <p>My advice is to subscribe to his YouTube page and watch his talks on Bitcoin. No one can explain Bitcoin better.</p>

        <p>Erik, along with Andreas, has been one of the best teachers of Bitcoin over the years, giving many different talks on YouTube.</p>
        <p>Erik when asked where you can find and follow him always recommends his Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Erik Voorhees</a> </p>

        <h2>Vijay Boyapati</h2>
        <p>Vijay wrote an article called <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">The Bullish Case for Bitcoin</a>.
        Many of the ideas and thoughts I shared on the home page were inspired by Vijay and Andreas and The Bullish Case for Bitcoin takes it further.</p>
        <p>Of all the articles that I've read on Bitcoin over the years, this is my favorite and most impactful.</p>

        <h2>Twitter</h2>
        <p>Twitter in general has become the public square and official news space for Bitcoin and crypto information. It has helped me keep up to date in real time of events happening in Bitcoin
            and of many great ideological discussions regarding its use and applications being built. I highly recommend using it and following these people to keep up to date! </p>

            <p>It should be noted that all of these people have different values and beliefs, but what they all have in common
                are excellent high quality takes on Bitcoin. Some are supportive of other cryptocurrencies, and others are not.
                (I personally do like a few others such as Ethereum, but the focus of this website will stay just on Bitcoin.)
