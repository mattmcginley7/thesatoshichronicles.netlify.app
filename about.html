<p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym
    Satoshi Nakamoto. It allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. Transactions are
    recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is widely regarded as the first decentralized cryptocurrency, and it has inspired the creation of hundreds of
    other cryptocurrencies. It is traded on exchanges all over the world and can be used to purchase goods and services
    from merchants who accept it as payment.</p>

<p>One of the main attractions of Bitcoin is that it is decentralized and not controlled by any government or financial
    institution. This means that it is not subject to inflation or manipulation by outside forces. It is also
    pseudonymous, meaning that users can transact without revealing their identities.</p>
